        <h1>Python Dataclasses Cheat Sheet</h1>
        <p>
          Python Dataclass syntax, released with Python version 3.7, offers the
          simplified way to create classes in Python. The only difference
          between regular classes and the dataclass is that in the dataclass,
          basic methods like <code class="inline-code">__init__</code>,
          <code class="inline-code">__repr__</code>,
          <code class="inline-code">__eq__</code> and some others are
          automatically generated for you by the dataclass.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="features">
        <h2>Creating A Dataclass</h2>
        <p>
          In order to create a dataclass you need to export
          <code class="inline-code">dataclass</code> from
          <code class="inline-code">dataclasses</code> and then use
          <code class="inline-code">@dataclass</code> decorator above the class
          name.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code class="code-block">
          from dataclasses import dataclass

          @dataclass
          class Person:
            first_name: str
            last_name: str
            age: int
        </code>
      </pre>
        <h2>Creating And Printing The Class Instance</h2>
        <p>
          The way to make an instance of a dataclass is the same as with regular
          classes. All you have to do is this:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code class="code-block">
          person1 = Person(first_name='John', last_name='Doe', age=35)
        </code>
    </pre>
        <p>
          And since the <code class="inline-code">__repr__</code> is generated
          by the dataclass itself, in order to output the instance you just
          created, you can do the following:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code class="code-block">
          print(f"My name is {person1.first_name} {person1.last_name} and I am {person1.age} years old")
        </code>
      </pre>
        <p>The output will look like:</p>
        <pre>
        <code class="code-block">
          My name is John Doe and I am 35 years old
        </code>
      </pre>
        <h2>Type Hints</h2>
        <p>
          Dataclasses support typing out of the box. When defining fields in
          dataclasses, it is mandatory to specify their type. Without a type
          hint, the field will not be a part of the dataclass. If you look back
          at the first example, we specify the type of the field:
          <code class="inline-code">first_name:str</code>,
          <code class="inline-code">last_name:str</code>,
          <code class="inline-code">age:int</code>
        </p>

        <h2>Default Values</h2>
        <p>
          It is easy to add default values to the the fields of your dataclass.
          The code in the following two examples comes from the
          <a
            href="https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/"
            rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >Real Python article on dataclasses</a
          >.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code class="code-block">
          from dataclasses import dataclass

          @dataclass
          class Position:
            name: str
            lon: float = 0.0
            lat: float = 0.0
        </code>
      </pre>
        <p>
          This works exactly as if you had specified the default values in the
          definition of the <code class="inline-code">.__init__()</code> method
          of a regular class:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code class="code-block">
          print(Position('Null Island'))
          Position(name='Null Island', lon=0.0, lat=0.0)
          
          print(Position('Greenwich', lat=51.8))
          Position(name='Greenwich', lon=0.0, lat=51.8)
          
          print(Position('Vancouver', -123.1, 49.3))
          Position(name='Vancouver', lon=-123.1, lat=49.3)
        </code>
      </pre>
        <h2>Creating And Using Methods In Dataclass</h2>
        <p>
          Since the dataclass is just like a regular class, you can create and
          use your own methods. The following example shows how to do this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-block">
            from dataclasses import dataclass

            @dataclass
            class School:
                """Class representing the School"""

                school_name: str
                school_level: str
                number_of_students: int

                def school_info(self) - &gt; str:
                    """Returns general School Info"""
                    return f"A {self.school_level} school named {self.school_name!r} with {self.number_of_students} students."

            mySchool = School(
              school_name="Codecademy Middle",
              school_level="middle",
              number_of_students=100
            )
                  
            print(mySchool.school_info())        
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The output of this code is:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-block">
            A middle school named 'Codecademy Middle' with 100 students.
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          Using inheritance (creating subclasses) in dataclasses is pretty
          simple. As an example, lets extend the
          <code class="inline-code">School</code> class and its
          <code class="inline-code">school_info</code> method with
          <code class="inline-code">PrimarySchool</code> class that has
          <code class="inline-code">pickup_policy</code> field:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-block">
            from dataclasses import dataclass

            @dataclass
            class School:
                """Parent class representing the School"""

                school_name: str
                school_level: str
                number_of_students: int

                def school_info(self) - &gt; str:
                    """Returns general School Info"""
                    return f"A {self.school_level} school named {self.school_name!r} with {self.number_of_students} students."


            @dataclass
            class PrimarySchool(School):
                """Child class representing the Primary School"""

                pickup_policy: str

                def school_info(self) - &gt; str:
                    """Adds Pickup Policy information"""
                    return f"{super().school_info()} The pickup policy is: {self.pickup_policy}"


            mySchool = School(
                school_name="Codecademy Middle",
                school_level="middle",
                number_of_students=100
            )

            myPrimary = PrimarySchool(
                school_name="Codecademy Primary",
                school_level="primary",
                number_of_students=300,
                pickup_policy="Pickup Allowed"
            )

            schools = [mySchool, myPrimary]

            for school in schools:
                print(school.school_info())
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The output of the above code is this:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-block">
            A middle school named 'Codecademy Middle' with 100 students.<br>
            A primary school named 'Codecademy Primary' with 300 students. The pickup policy is: Pickup Allowed
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The fields in the subclass follow the order of the fields of the
          parent class. In our example, the order of the fields in the <code class="inline-code">__init__</code> method will look like this:
          <pre>
            <code class="code-block">
              def __init__(self, school_name: str, school_level:str, number_of_students: int, pickup_policy: str):
                ...
            </code>
          </pre> 
        </p>
        <p>Which means that since in Python default arguments must follow non-default ones, when any fields in the parent class have default values, the fields in the child class must have a default value also.</p>
        <h2>Creating A List in Dataclass</h2>
        <p>To create a list in the dataclass you need to add <code class="inline-code">field</code> to the <code class="inline-code">from dataclasses import dataclass</code> import statement, like so:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-block">
            from dataclasses import dataclass, field
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.field" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">field()</a> function has many parameters, but the one used in list creation is the <code class="inline-code">default_factory</code>. It must be specified when creating the new instance of the list. To demonstrate this, let's extend <code class="inline-code">School</code> class with <code class="inline-code">HighSchool</code> class:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-block">
            from dataclasses import dataclass, field


            @dataclass
            class School:
                """Parent class representing the School"""

                school_name: str
                school_level: str
                number_of_students: int

                def school_info(self) - &gt; str:
                    """Returns general School Info"""

                    return f"A {self.school_level} school named {self.school_name!r} with {self.number_of_students} students."


            @dataclass
            class PrimarySchool(School):
                """Primary School class"""

                pickup_policy: str

                def school_info(self) - &gt; str:
                    """Adds Pickup Policy information"""
                    return f"{super().school_info()} The pickup policy is: {self.pickup_policy}"


            @dataclass
            class HighSchool(School):
                """High School class"""

                sports_teams: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)

                def school_info(self) - &gt; str:
                    """Adds Information about the sports teams"""

                    return f"{super().school_info()} It includes the following sports teams: {self.sports_teams}"

                def addTeam(self, sports_team: str) - &gt; None:
                    """Appends a new team to the sportsTeams list"""

                    if sports_team not in self.sports_teams:
                        self.sports_teams.append(sports_team)


            mySchool = School(
                school_name="Codecademy Middle",
                school_level="middle",
                number_of_students=100
            )

            myPrimary = PrimarySchool(
                school_name="Codecademy Primary",

                number_of_students=300,
                pickup_policy="Pickup Allowed"
            )

            myHighSchool = HighSchool(
                school_name="Codecademy High",
                school_level="high",
                number_of_students=500,
                sports_teams=["Tennis", "Basketball"]
            )

            myHighSchool.addTeam("Hockey")

          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Note: In Python version pre 3.9, you need to add the following import statement: <code class="inline-code">from typing import List</code> and change the line in the <code class="inline-code">HighSchool</code> class to this: <code class="inline-code">sports_teams: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)</code></p>
        <h2>Optimizing Dataclasses by using __slots__</h2>
        <p>To make classes faster and use less memory you can use the <code class="inline-code">__slots__</code>. They are defined using <code class="inline-code">.__slots__</code> to list the variables on a class. Variables or attributes not present in <code class="inline-code">.__slots__</code> may not be defined. Furthermore, a slots class may not have default values. When subclasses without slots inherit from base class containing slots, they inherit slots too.</p>
